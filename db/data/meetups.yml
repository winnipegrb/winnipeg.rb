    Action Pack Under The Hood

    Have you ever wondered how routing in Rails actually works? This talk is all about the journey from request to response within a Rails server. Along the way, you'll learn about the internals that make it all possible, and some performance tips to make web applications faster at scale.

    The talk will start at 6:30PM. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.

    We're back with a workshop on Rubocop!

    Doors open at 6, and the workshop starts at 6:30. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.

- name: Integrating Threat Modelling + Keeping Rails App Development Fast
  description: |
    Integrating Threat Modelling in Web Application Teams with Adam Krieger

    Attackers don't play by the rules. Attackers will do whatever they can to disrupt, steal, or manipulate applications and their data. The STRIDE framework is a key tool in analyzing our applications, understanding the threats these attackers pose, and building countermeasures commensurate with risk. Combine that with an operationalized Secure SDLC approach and your organization can implement the security controls needed to keep your data safe. The path to Secure Design is there, but you need to take the steps. Join me in this talk to spread awareness about effectively integrating threat modelling into your application design process.

    How to Keep Rails App Development Fast with Gannon McGibbon

    Is your web application slow to boot? How long does it take to run a single test? In this talk, you'll learn how to keep Rails application development fast, how to profile an application, and ways to catch speed regressions.

    Doors open at 5:30, and talks starts at 6:00. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.

- name: Making a Game with DragonRuby

    **ORMs are Fine with Alexander Trauzzi**

    Plenty of misinformation has taken hold over the years around ORMs. It varies by ecosystem, but is found everywhere and has sometimes even earned ORMs a negative reputation.

    We'll spend a bit of time together understanding ORMs, what they are, the ways in which they can help, as well as the ways they are misunderstood. We'll also look briefly at the mix of validity and relevance when it comes to performance claims.

    This talk is aimed at people doing the design and development of software, although others connected to the building and releasing can benefit too!

    Questions and discussion welcome afterwards!

    **Making a Game with DragonRuby with Gannon McGibbon**

    Let's kickoff 2025 with some game development!

    Most programmers know you can build games with Unity or Unreal, but did you know you can use Ruby too?
    In this talk, you'll learn about [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org/), a cross-platform Ruby runtime.
    We'll focus on building a simple game from scratch using the [DragonRuby game toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk).

    Doors open at 6, and the talk starts at 6:30. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.

    This meetup is sponsored by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and [Launch Coworking](https://launchcoworking.ca/).
