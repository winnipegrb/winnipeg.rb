    Action Pack Under The Hood

    Have you ever wondered how routing in Rails actually works? This talk is all about the journey from request to response within a Rails server. Along the way, you'll learn about the internals that make it all possible, and some performance tips to make web applications faster at scale.

    The talk will start at 6:30PM. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.

- name: Enforcing style guides with Rubocop
  description: |
    We're back with a workshop on Rubocop!

    Is your codebase opinionated? Does it have hidden rules and best practices that aren't strongly enforced? In this workshop you'll learn about the importance of a style guide, how to implement one in Ruby, and how to build your own Rubocop cops to enforce arbitrary rules.

    Doors open at 6, and the workshop starts at 6:30. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.
