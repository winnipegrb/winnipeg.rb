    Action Pack Under The Hood

    Have you ever wondered how routing in Rails actually works? This talk is all about the journey from request to response within a Rails server. Along the way, you'll learn about the internals that make it all possible, and some performance tips to make web applications faster at scale.

    The talk will start at 6:30PM. Food and drinks will be provided at the venue.
